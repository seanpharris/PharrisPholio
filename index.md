## Most recent project
[CryptoAnalysisPipe](https://github.com/seanpharris/CryptoAnalysisPipe/blob/main/README.md)
* This is a pipeline that keeps over 100 different cryptocurrencies market data up to date
* The data comes from a RapidAPI by Alpha Vantage to call and store daily records for cryptocurrencies
* Each crypto's data is stored its own CSV file (files found in kaggle)
* It updates the data every Wednesday at midnight 
* The notebook can be found at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/seanpharris/cryptoanalysispipe)
* You may run the notebook yourself or use the output files from the one I made (linked above)
